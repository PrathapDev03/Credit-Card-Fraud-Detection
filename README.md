Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning
Abstract:
With the rise of online banking and credit card usage, fraudulent activities have become more common. This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, minimizing the risk to users and businesses. Supervised learning methods are employed to classify transactions, helping to identify potential fraud effectively.

Problem Statement:
Fraudulent transactions cause significant damage to companies' reputations and customer trust. The aim of this project is to develop a model that can detect credit card fraud with high accuracy, minimizing false positives, and ensuring quick response to potential fraudulent activities.

Dataset:
The dataset contains anonymized credit card transactions, including details like transaction amount, merchant, and time. Fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions are labeled to facilitate supervised learning.

Features and Techniques:
Preprocessing:

Features like Amount and Time are scaled.
Imbalanced classes are handled through techniques like undersampling or oversampling.
Feature Engineering:

New features such as transaction frequency, location mismatch, and spending patterns are derived.
Modeling:

Various machine learning algorithms like Isolation Forest and Random Forest are used to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.
Evaluation:

Model performance is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
The aim is to minimize false positives while maintaining high accuracy in detecting fraud.
